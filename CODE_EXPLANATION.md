SECURELOG PROJECT - CODE STRUCTURE AND EXPLANATION

This document explains the overall architecture and code organization
of the SecureLog incident reporting system to help with analysis and understanding.

=== PROJECT OVERVIEW ===

SecureLog is a Django-based web application for workplace incident reporting.
It allows staff to report incidents, managers to track and assign them,
and provides a dashboard for monitoring workplace safety.

Assessment Requirements Met:
✅ LO1: Agile methodology, responsive design, accessibility
✅ LO2: Custom data model, CRUD operations, notifications  
✅ LO3: Authentication, authorization, access control
✅ LO4: Testing procedures and documentation
✅ LO5: Git version control with meaningful commits
✅ LO6: Cloud deployment (Heroku-ready)
✅ LO7: Custom object-based data models
✅ LO8: AI-assisted development (documented in README)

=== KEY FILES EXPLAINED ===

1. MODELS.PY - Database Schema
   - IncidentReport: Main custom model (assessment requirement)
   - IncidentType: Categorization system
   - IncidentComment: User comments on reports
   - IncidentStatusHistory: Audit trail for status changes
   
   Key Features:
   - Foreign key relationships between models
   - Choice fields for consistent data (severity, status)
   - Automatic timestamp tracking
   - Custom properties for business logic
   - File upload capability

2. VIEWS.PY - Business Logic
   - Class-based views for CRUD operations
   - Authentication and authorization controls
   - Dashboard with statistics and recent incidents
   - AJAX endpoints for dynamic functionality
   
   Security Features:
   - LoginRequiredMixin ensures authentication
   - Users can only edit their own reports (unless staff)
   - Role-based access control

3. FORMS.PY - User Input Handling
   - ModelForms automatically generate from models
   - Custom widgets for better user experience
   - Field validation and required field enforcement
   - Bootstrap CSS integration via crispy-forms

4. TEMPLATES/ - User Interface
   - base.html: Common layout, navigation, styling
   - Semantic HTML5 structure for accessibility
   - Bootstrap 4 for responsive design
   - Django template language for dynamic content
   - CSRF protection for security

5. SETTINGS.PY - Django Configuration
   - Environment variable usage (no secrets in code)
   - Database configuration (SQLite dev, PostgreSQL prod)
   - Static file handling with WhiteNoise
   - Security settings for production deployment

=== DATA FLOW EXPLANATION ===

1. USER REQUEST:
   User visits URL (e.g., /incidents/create/)
   
2. URL ROUTING:
   Django checks urls.py files to find matching pattern
   
3. VIEW PROCESSING:
   Appropriate view function/class handles the request
   - Checks authentication/permissions
   - Processes any form data
   - Queries database via models
   
4. TEMPLATE RENDERING:
   View passes data to HTML template
   Template renders dynamic content using Django template language
   
5. HTTP RESPONSE:
   Rendered HTML sent back to user's browser

=== SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION ===

Authentication:
- Django's built-in User model
- LoginRequiredMixin protects sensitive views
- Role-based access (staff vs regular users)

Authorization:
- Users can only edit their own reports
- Staff can view/edit all reports
- Access control in views and templates

Security Best Practices:
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Environment variables for sensitive settings
- DEBUG=False in production
- Secure static file serving with WhiteNoise
- No hardcoded secrets in version control

=== DATABASE RELATIONSHIPS ===

User (Django built-in)
  ├── reported_incidents (ForeignKey from IncidentReport.reported_by)
  └── assigned_incidents (ForeignKey from IncidentReport.assigned_to)

IncidentType
  └── incident_reports (ForeignKey from IncidentReport.incident_type)

IncidentReport (MAIN MODEL)
  ├── comments (ForeignKey from IncidentComment.incident)  
  └── status_history (ForeignKey from IncidentStatusHistory.incident)

=== DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE ===

Development Environment:
- SQLite database (file-based)
- Django development server
- DEBUG=True for detailed errors

Production Environment (Heroku):
- PostgreSQL database (cloud-hosted)
